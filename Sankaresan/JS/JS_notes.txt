# JAVASCRIPT :-
--> it is use to ad functionality into webapp.
--> it is interpreted language.
--> it is loosely typed language.



# Q1: Why js is loosely typed lang ?
-- when we create a var in js, we cant determine that, what type of data it contain until and unless initialize it.
-- in js, we can store multiple data tpye variables. 



# Q2: How to use js ?
--> there are 2 ways to use it,
1. internal js : in html file, we use script tag and in that we write js code.
2. external js : in this we create a separate js file and import that js file in html file by using script tag.



# Q3: How to get output in js ?
1. document.write() : it will display o/p in html page. 
2. window.alert()   : it will display o/p in model popup window.
3. console.log()    : it will display o/p in browser console or terminal.
4. innerHTML(DOM)   : it will display o/p inside an element.
