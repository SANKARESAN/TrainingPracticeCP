# JAVASCRIPT :-
--> it is use to ad functionality into webapp.
--> it is interpreted language.
--> it is loosely typed language.



# Q1: Why js is loosely typed lang ?
-- when we create a var in js, we cant determine that, what type of data it contain until and unless initialize it.
-- in js, we can store multiple data tpye variables. 



# Q2: How to use js ?
--> there are 2 ways to use it,
1. internal js : in html file, we use script tag and in that we write js code.
2. external js : in this we create a separate js file and import that js file in html file by using script tag.



# Q3: How to get output in js ?
1. document.write() : it will display o/p in html page. 
2. window.alert()   : it will display o/p in model popup window.
3. console.log()    : it will display o/p in browser console or terminal.
4. innerHTML(DOM)   : it will display o/p inside an element.

# Hosting : moving var and func declaration at top of webpage.


# VARIABLE : it is use to store data in it.
           : we can create variable in JS by using var, let, const. 

1. VAR : it create function scope variable.
    : we can use variable before its declaration.
    : we can re-declare the variable.

ex;
    var mydata; // var declaration
    mydata = "changepond";       //  var initialization
    var yourName = "Rahul";      //  defing a variable



2. LET : it create block scope variable.
       : we cannot use var before its declaration.
       : we can not re-declare variable.


3. const : it create block scope var
         : we can not use var before its declaration
         : in this when wqe declare a variable at same time we have initialize it.
         : its data will never change or run time.
 

- exponentiation (**) : it return power  of any number.


== (equal to) : it check value only and if both are same then it will return true value
ex : 5 == 5
    true
ex : 5 == '5'
    true     

=== (exactly equal to) : it will check value as well as its data and if both are same then it will return true value
ex : 5 === 5
    true
ex : 5 === '5'
    true

# DOM MANIPULATION :

# FUNCTION : it is block of code which is used to perform specific task
           : func will execute only when we call it.
           : fucn can be re-use.

# there are mainly two-types of functions,
1. predefine function : provide js to us.
2. usedefine function : user developed for particular use.

syntax :-

function  function_Name(){
    //logical code
}
function_Name();


# How to change attribute value by using DOM
# How to call function by using event
# How to access data from input control

# ARRAY : it is use to store multiple values with same data type.
        : in array data store on index basis.
        : array index always start from zero index.
        : we can access array values oudtide nby writing arrayName[indexNumber].

# ARRAY METHOD

# OBJECT : it is use to store multiple values with different data type.
         : in obj dtata store in key and value paired format.
         : we can access object data outside of by writing object.keyName.
         : obj type of data is denoted by {}

5. display information of all employee who belong to Tamil-nadu ? 


TASK : perform form validation for password, email, contact, gender?

# CALLBACK FUNCTION : passing a function name as argument inside another function is called callback func.


# DATE AND TIME :- 

--> If we want to diplay date and time in js first we have obj of date class.
--> Date object return information from browser.

let objName = new Date();
sun = 0
mon = 1
sat = 6


jan = 0
feb = 1
.
.
dec = 11



# FORM VALIDATION :  checking user enter data in correct or wrong.
